## What is an NPM package?

So, you have written some piece of code, and you are using it in `project A`. Next day, you decide to create `project B` and find out that it would be nice to share this code between projects. How do you do that? Copying the code from one project to another is a solution, but sooner or later you will realize that your code had a bug. It wasn't anything significant, so you applied a quick fix, add tests and now your code is working properly again. The problem here is that you forgot to redo the same steps in project `B` so the code in `project B` is still buggy. Here NPM packages come into play. They provide a way to avoid those kinds of situations and easily share code among many projects. In this tutorial, I will show you how to create your own NPM package containing utility functions with TypeScript, Jest and CI/CD with GitHub actions.

## Start a new project

To get started we need to create a repository for our package and install dependencies.

```shell
# Create a directory for the package.
mkdir common-utils
# Go to projects directory.
cd common-utils
# Initialize the project.
yarn init -y
# Install dependencies.
yarn add -D typescript jest ts-jest @types/jest
```

After the installation is complete we need to initialize `tsconfig.json` file. I usually do that with some help from `npx` tool. You can read more about it [here](https://dev.to/matheusgomes062/what-is-npx-2oj9).

```shell
# Initialize tsconfig.json file.
npx tsc --init
```

Create a new folder named `src`. Here we will keep our source code for all utility functions. Additionally, we need to create `index.ts` file which will act as entry point to other parts of our code.

```shell
# Create source code directory.
mkdir src
# Create entrypoint for the package.
touch src/index.ts
```

## Setup scripts

Before we jump into writing code, we have to set up some npm scripts that will run tests or compile TypeScript to JavaScript files. Add `scripts` key in `package.json` file with the following configuration.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc",
    "test": "jest --watch",
    "test-ci": "CI=true jest"
  }
}
```

- `build` - Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript.
- `test` - Runs `jest` in watch mode.
- `test-ci` - Runs `jest` in continuous integration environment.

## Configure Jest

Before we can run our automated tests, we have to do a little more configuration. During the development, we are working with TypeScript files, but Jest doesn't know how to handle them by itself. Thus, we've installed `ts-jest` package that preprocesses TS files so that jest can understand what we are doing. To create a preconfigured `jest.config.js` file you can simply run `yarn ts-jest config:init` in root directory.

## Prepare code

For the sake of simplicity, we will create a pure function called `add`. It will serve as an example of how the build and deployment process looks like.

```shell
# Create a directory for the function code.
mkdir src/add
# Create a file with function.
touch src/add/add.ts
# Create a file with tests.
touch src/add/add.test.ts
```

The code is as simple as it could be, so we are only adding two numbers here.

```ts
export const add = (a: number, b: number): number => a + b
```

In test file, we are going to check if our function works as expected with a simple test case.

```ts
import { add } from './add'

describe('add function', () => {
  test('should add two numbers', () => {
    const result = add(1, 2)

    expect(result).toEqual(3)
  })
})
```

To confirm that our tests are passing, run `yarn test` in the terminal. After those steps, we have to reexport our `add` function from the `index.ts` file. This operation will allow us to have nicer imports after we deploy our package. We will have `import { add } from 'common-utils'` instead of something like `import { add } from 'common-utils/dist/add`.

## Tweak `tsconfig.json` file

Before we can run `tsc` to compile our project we must modify some options in `tsconfig.json` file. Basically, we want a few things to happen:

- Compile all files in `src` directory to `dist` directory. We will point to `dist` directory from `package.json` to indicate import place for our functions.
- Emit declaration files. They provide better autocomplete, protect you from misusing libraries (e.g. by passing incorrect function arguments) and describe the shape of codebase, so you don't have to reach to documentation that often.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "declaration": true,
    "declarationMap": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "module": "ES2015",
    "noEmit": false,
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "rootDir": "./src",
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "sourceMap": true,
    "strict": true,
    "target": "ES2015"
  },
  "exclude": ["src/**/*.test.ts", "src/**/*.test.utils.ts", "src/**/*.types.ts"]
}
```

## Tweak `package.json` file

We are almost ready to deploy our package to NPM. The problem is, our `package.json` is not properly configured yet. Let's have a look at what we need to add or modify in our `package.json` to publish the package to NPM.

```json
{
  "name": "@ofadiman/common-utils",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "typings": "dist/index.d.ts",
  "license": "MIT",
  "author": {
    "email": "ofadiman@gmail.com",
    "name": "Szymon Jaworski",
    "url": "https://github.com/Ofadiman"
  },
  "description": "JavaScript & TypeScript utilities.",
  "bugs": "https://github.com/Ofadiman/common-utils/issues",
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=14.0.0"
  },
  "files": ["LICENSE", "dist"],
  "keywords": ["javascript", "plop", "typescript", "utils"],
  "private": false,
  "publishConfig": {
    "access": "public"
  },
  "repository": "Ofadiman/common-utils"
}
```

The **name** and **version** together form an identifier that is assumed to be completely unique. Because of the abundance of NPM packages out there, we probably won't be able to choose a **name** we want. Here scoped packages come into play. We can add `@scope/` before the package name to create a [scoped](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/scope) package. Usually, the scope name is your username or organization.

The **version** field indicates our current state of the codebase. To manage code versioning we follow the [semver](https://semver.org/) convention.

The **main** field is a module ID that is the primary entry point to your program. By passing `dist/index.js` as the value here, we tell that our code should be taken from `node_modules/@scope/package/dist/index.js` when we type something like `import { add } from '@scope/package'`.

The **typings** field declares a path where our type definition files are.

The **publishConfig** is a set of config values that will be used at publish-time. All we have to remember here is that the `"access": "public"` key-value pair is required to publish scoped packages to public use.

The other config options are not mandatory, but it's good to have them e.g. for displaying nicely formatted information about our package in NPM. You can read more about other keys available in package.json [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/package-json).
